/*The goal of this quiz is to practice writing and reading files.
**Read the contents of input.txt and then write to it.
**
**We are using input.txt as our file. This is not an ideal
**situation, because when we write to it, we cannot
**see the changes. We can manually write in input.txt and
**we can also use the program to write to the file.
**Then we can read what we wrote using our program.
**
**Your assignment for this quiz**
**Change the contents of the file called input.txt
**Change the ifstream and ofstream to fstream
